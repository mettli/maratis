For the moment this project works with cygwin build as some path contains the cygwin keyword because the Maratis Scons build writes the libs in a folder containing the build platform name:
/build/platform/release/...
It should be although possible to adapt to any platform by creating a variable in codeblock storing the platform (cygwin, linux, mac...) and using it in path :
../../build/$PLATFORM/release/...
